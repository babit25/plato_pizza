# Introduction
Plato Pizza is a  Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey, USA. According to the manager, Mario Maven, things are going OK  at the restaurant, but there’s room for improvement. They have been collecting transaction data for the past year, but really haven’t been able to put it to good use. They have made the decision to hire me  as a BI consultant to help the restaurant use 
data to improve operations and find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

# Business Questions

Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:

• What days and times do we tend to be busiest?

• What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?

• What's our average order value?

• How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any 
seasonality in the sales?
